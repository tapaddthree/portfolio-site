It takes in "from_service", an instance of the class of the service you are transferring from, "to_service", an instance of the class of the service you are transferring to, and the playlist tracks from the "from_service". The first method, "get_stripped_playlist_tracks", is responsible for removing all of the un-needed data from each playlist track, as well as fixing any naming discrepancies. The function "fix_ampersand_symbol" on line 13 is responsible for keeping naming conventions with "&" the same. For example, if there was an artist on one of the songs that was "Artist & Artist," the function would change it to "Artist and Artist." This helps to make the search results better. "remove_duplicates" will simply go through and remove any duplicate songs that are in a playlist. This function works by using a set on line 25 to keep track of the songs that we have seen. If for any reason a duplicate song was to be attempted to be added to the set, it would instead skip it, otherwise it gets added to the "dupe_removed_playlist_tracks" list on line 26. The final method on line 40 "convert_playlist" is responsible for invoking the "create_playlist" method on the "to_service" that is passed into the playlist class.',

For interfacing with YouTube I used the python package "ytmusicapi." You will see the self variable "self.ytmusic" on line 8 used frequently throughout this class. It is required for any interactions that require communicating with YouTube. The first method "initialize_playlist" simply creates a new, empty playlist on YouTube music. "get_all_playlists" fetches all of the playlists of the authenticated user. On line 23 you can see it ignores the "LM" and "SE" playlists. These are the default YouTube playlists that are not very revelant. The following "get_all_tracks" method does basically the same thing, but takes in a specific playlist id and then fetches all of the tracks for that given playlist.',

Line 10 appends all of the revelant data to "self.search_results," a list we will use throughout the YouTube class. Each search result is comprised of two results: "track, artist, and videoId" which is the first result from YouTube and "alternate_track, alternate_artist, and alternate_videoId," which is the second result from YouTube. The alternate result is very important as the first search result from YouTube turns out to not always be what we want.',

If it is not, perform a second search with the alternate artist data and then compare the two. If there is not a match again, remove the song and add it to the "removed_tracks" list (line 30), add a "skip" key to the given track, then continue.',

If it is, the rest of the function is skipped, if not there is another check. If there is an open parantheses in the track, check to see if the tracks equal without the parantheses.
